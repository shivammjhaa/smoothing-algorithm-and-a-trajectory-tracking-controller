# smoothing-algorithm-and-a-trajectory-tracking-controller
ROS 2 package for trajectory generation and path tracking using a differential drive robot (TurtleBot3 in Gazebo). It smooths a series of 2D waypoints, generates a time-parameterized trajectory, and uses odometry-based feedback control to follow the path.
